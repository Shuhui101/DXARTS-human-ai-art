# DXARTS-human-ai-art
After reviewing my project idea with the class, I changed my concept to a focus on 3d printing. Overall, the project description remains the same, examining the benefits of collaborating with ai generative art to enhance the creativity of human artists. Instead of creating a display with a camera that provides live ai assistance, I will be utilizing the image to image feature of DALL-E to make 3d printed sculptures.
